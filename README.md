Simple php serving of the content of a Calibre LIbrary

## Local serving
I wanted to make the contents of my Calibre Library available to the other members of my family. Running Calibre with it's built in server was simply too much of a load, so I wrote these few simple php Pages to serve the contents of the library.

## SBBS
I started running the BBS system [Synchronet BBS](https://www.synchro.net/). I moved my scripts to the directory `c:\sbbs\webv4\root\Library` and copied my Calibre Library into the directory `mylibrary` under that directory. All runs fine.

## MetaData
I still need to extract the metadata from the metadata.opf (xml file) which resides in the same directory as the epub. Unfortunately, I cannot get my head around XML so any help there would be appreciated.
